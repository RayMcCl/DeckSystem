Changelog for Card Game

5/14
Decided on breaking code down into a simple structure : 
DeckManager - Loaded Deck's Sprite information, Singleton Pattern
Deck - A set of cards
	cards - Array of cards
Hand - A set of cards
	cards - Array of cards, linked list?
	handMax - Maximum Hand Size
	
Card - A single card
	cardType - The Suit of the Card : Spades, Clubs, Diamonds, or Hearts
	cardName - The name of the Card : Ace, King, Queen, Jack, 10, etc
	sprite - The loaded card image based on the naming convention : cardName + "Of" + cardType, AceOfSpades

Created FollowMouse script for card

5/15
--Changed DeckManager from Singleton design pattern, considering multiple players with different deck types (non-standard 52 card decks)
Decided to add Player class for multiplayer support
Player - An individual player
	Hand - Current hand
	Deck - Current deck

Changed DeckManager back to Singleton design pattern, allowed for multiple decks through multidimensional array. When a player 
loads in their deck	name is sent to the DeckManager which then pulls the sprite sheet information from the Resources folder

	deckIndex : int - Index of the Deck this card is from
	backName : string - Path name of back of card

Added Flip animation for cards and updated card prefab
Added Flip functionality to Card script under FlipCard() method, called halfway through the Flip animation

Considering using JSON.net library to handle importing deck from simple text documents, other considerations include 
storing data on SQL server

Decided to store data using CSV file format to allow for quick prototyping, created 52Card.csv with basic format
Created Parser static class for global text parsing and updated Deck class to include LoadDeck functionality

Implemented Deck drawing functionality
Updated DeckManager class name and variable names to SpriteManager, updated related variables and method calls to reflect this change
